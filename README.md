Thank you for visiting Settlers of Fullstack, a digital port of the popular strategy board game Settlers of Catan.

Settlers of Fullstack was built by Frank Malafronte, Ryan Powers, Patrick Monaghan, and Steven Warren as a capstone project at Fullstack Academy.
It was built over 10 coding days in the fall of 2018.

You can visit our deployed app at settlers-of-fullstack.herokuapp.com
Once on the page, you can view a single player Demo version of the game by navigating to the "How To" Link.
This Demo will allow you to test drive some of the features of the game without needing to start a four player game.
A full game requires four logged in users to join a game in the game lobby. If you would like to experience all our game has to offer
